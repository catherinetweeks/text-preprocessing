<h1>Text Preprocessing</h1>

**This program takes an article (copy and paste link in terminal) and from it extracts and preprocesses the body of text.** It does this by making 2 lists, one where all the words are lowercase (for analyzing the frequency of various words), and another of the words how they appear in the text. I also experimented with **named entity recognition** and fidning the most common words and their **frequency** in the text.

<h2>Named Entity Recognition</h2>
The file ner.py will output a list of the named entities followed by the type of entity (Organization, person, etc.)

<h2>Frequency</h2>
The file frequency.py will output a list of the 5 most frequent words in the text.
